# Smart-Char-App-With-Emotion-Detector

## About
The project aimed to enhance the deliverability of a smart chat application by combining with
human facial expressions and face recognition using Artificial Intelligence. The system is a web
application that automatically suggests emojis, stickers, or gifs by detecting the user's facial
expressions at the moment. The user is able to choose the right emoji or sticker at the right time from
the suggestion of the system.

## Limitations
We hoped to use AI model for predictions. We need consider accuracy of our model and size of our
model.
From using Deep Learning, we used AI model with better accuracy and good amount of size, but we
need lot number of tunings for develop good accurate model (identifying layers). But for we needed
lot of computation power and lot of training time for identify layers.
Therefore, we hope to use Transfer Learning Techniques. From using transfer learning techniques,
we have get good accurate model, but model size is not that much good.
